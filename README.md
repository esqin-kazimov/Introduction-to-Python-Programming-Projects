# Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Projects

The projects in this repository are designed to help you develop your analysis skills by
providing you with the opportunity to practice breaking small problems down into
sequences of steps. In addition, completing these projects will help you become
familiar with Python’s syntax. To complete each projects you should expect to use
some or all of these Python features:

• Generate output with print statements

• Read input, including casting that input to the appropriate type

• Perform calculations involving integers and floating point numbers using Python
operators like +, -, *, /, //, %, and **

• Call functions residing in the math module

• Control how output is displayed using format specifiers
